                and other institutes to show their products all over the world.The websites that catch you through their
                look and funcationalities are built by Web Developer.Here we will disscuss very basics of web
                development after getting these all we have to master other tachnologies also, like Frameworks &
                Libaries that are many in number, because tech have evolved too much and require best
                quality in short time.To become a Web Developer, learn Web Development Course about which some
                have their opinion that it has three parts i.e Forentend Part, Backend Part & DataBase Part while
                others argue that web development consists of two main parts Frontend part & Backend part & DataBase is
                classified as a subclass of
                Backend Part;

                        of the web.
                        The experts of that part of web are called <b>Frontend Web Developer</b>.One wanting to have
                        Carrer in it should learn three very basic technologies named as; HTML, CSS & JavaScript.Instead
                        of JavaScript(Js) other Programming language can be used but as a beginner we have to learn Js
                        because of having it's forgiving nature & many more beginner friendly features.Js forgiving
                        nature means that it doesn't throw an erorr & forgive our minor mistakes like not placing
                        semi-column after completion of a statment,that enhance our spirit towards Coding.

                            Developer</b>.To master this we will deal with Node.js,if we belongs to JavaScript
                        programming language background.In case of having Python background, we have to learn
                        Django,Along with one of these technology we have to strong grip on one of Data Type i.e: SQL
                        Data & No-SQL Data.Data Types are Sometime classified in separate group is called DataBase.

                <p>Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.Here,Cross-platform
                    mean's that Node.js can run on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.Node.js
                    allows developers to write JavaScript code that runs directly in a computer process itself instead
                    of in a browser. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!.Node.js allows developers to
                    use JavaScript on both the client-side(Frontend) and server-side(Backend).Node. js is primarily used
                    for backend development.The biggest benefit of Node.Js is that it provide high performance for
                    Real-time Applications.It has frameworks like Express.js,Koa.js etc</p>

                <h4>Django:</h4>
                <p>Django is a free, open-source framework that provides an architecture, templates, and APIs to build
                    web applications quickly and efficiently. It's often referred to as a "batteries included" framework
                    because of its comprehensive set of built-in features. Django, a high-level Python web framework
                    that enables rapid development of secure, maintainable, and scalable websites.It has Feature like
                    MODULAR DESIGN which allows us to build and reuse components, making development faster and more
                    efficient.Both Django and Node.js are used for building backend applications.The most obvious
                    difference is the programming language used. Django is built on Python, while Node.js is built on
                    JavaScript.

                    <p>
                        In SQL, data types determine the type of value that can be stored in a column or variable.
                        Understanding data types is essential for designing and working with databases.SQL data types
                        define the format, size, and range of values that can be stored in a database column or
                        variable.Main categories of SQL data type are Numeric Data Type, Character Data Type, Binary
                        Data Type and Date & Time Data Type. SQL data types play a crucial role in database design and
                        development. Understanding the different data types and their uses helps ensure data integrity,
                        efficiency, and accuracy. By choosing the right data type and following best practices, you can
                        create robust and efficient databases.

                        NoSQL databases, also known as non-relational databases, provide a mechanism for storing and
                        retrieving data in a flexible, scalable, and high-performance manner.NoSQL databases are
                        designed to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data and provide a more
                        flexible schema than traditional relational databases.Main Types of No-SQL Data Types are;
                        Key-Value Stores, Document-Oriented Databases,Column-Family Databases,Graph Databases.NoSQL data
                        types are suitable for:<br>
                        - Storing and retrieving large amounts of content, such as documents, images, and videos.<br>
                        - Handling large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data.<br>
                        - Handling large amounts of user-generated data and providing high-performance data retrieval
